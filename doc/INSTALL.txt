This project requires a recent version of SIP (tested with 4.17), Qt4, PyQt4 and libQGLViewer.

Note: PyQt4 should be installed with its sip and development files.

To build Python wrapper , you should simply do the following command
> python configure.py
You can specify the source repository of libQGLViewer with -Q option.
For instance
> python configure.py -Q ../libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3

Note: on windows you may have to specify the include and lib directories also, using absolute paths
> python configure.py -Q ../libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3 -I c:\path_to_libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3 -L c:\path_to_libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3\QGLViewer\release

Then you simply have to compile and install with
> make (or nmake)
> make install (or nmake install, you should be root)

You can then test the new module with all examples
that you can find in the directory PyQGLViewer/examples.

Good luck,

Fred
